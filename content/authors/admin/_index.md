I am a PhD student in Data Science at the Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Technion, working under the supervision of [Dana Drachsler-Cohen](https://ddana.net.technion.ac.il/).
My research explores how eye movements in reading are related to different reading tasks and to reading comprehension.
